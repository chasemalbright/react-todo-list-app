      <p>This is the Todo list app v1.0.0. It is simple React app that I used to practice displaying components, using the router, structure with JSX, and logic with functionality between elements. The latin placeholders are pulled from a get request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos by axios. </p>

    </React.Fragment>
